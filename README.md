# Mico - Mirror and Compare
> The purpose of this project is to practice using libraries, video processing tools, as well as creating a GUI in Python.

### Description:
- Created a video editing application using Python, Moviepy, and Tkinter to synchronize and analyze two videos with similar audios.
- Implemented a user-friendly interface allowing users to input a YouTube link for one video and select a local video file for comparison.
- Developed a backend system to analyze the audio of the videos and synchronize them, resulting in a layered video file with the synced videos.
- Incorporated functionality to extract audio from a YouTube video and replace the audio of a local video.

### Key Features:
- Developed a robust backend system utilizing Python, Moviepy, and Tkinter to handle video synchronization and analysis.
- Designed an intuitive user interface that enables seamless interaction, including inputting YouTube links and selecting local video files.
- Implemented audio extraction from YouTube videos, enhancing the flexibility of the application.
- Utilized Moviepy library to generate layered videos with synchronized content, providing a comprehensive visual comparison.
- Ensured efficient processing and synchronization of videos by leveraging Python's powerful capabilities.
- Streamlined the editing process by automating audio replacement, enabling users to customize their video content.

### Technologies Used:
- Python: Utilized Python as the primary programming language for the application development.
- Moviepy: Employed the Moviepy library for video editing functionalities, including synchronization and layering.
- YouTube API: Leveraged the YouTube API to extract audio from YouTube videos and incorporate it into the local videos.
- Tkinter and CustomTkinter: Utilized Tkinter and CustomTkinter libraries to create an interactive and visually appealing user interface.
- Threaded Programming: Implemented threaded programming techniques to enhance performance and responsiveness during video processing.
- PyInstaller: Utilized PyInstaller to package the application into an executable for easy distribution and installation.

### The next step ?

> Make the app downloadable in a setup wizard file to distribute it.
